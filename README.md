# qore-freebsd-ports
FreeBSD Ports configuration

Current List:

./lang-qore - contains Port files for lang/qore (http://www.freshports.org/lang/qore/)

TODO:

The plan is to add more Qore Ports to FreeBSD, maybe even a meta-port that allows one
to select core Qore language support along with popular Qore modules (e.g., MySQL, JSON, etc).
